# Tinder-clone
I have made this project using MERN stack
To run this project, first go to tinder directory using #cd tinder
Then run #npm start
This will start the frontend part of the project
After that open a new terminal and go to tinder-backend directory using #cd tinder-backend
Then run #node server.js
This will start the backend part of the project
If this project helped you in learning a little, do give a thumbsup(like) to this project
Thank You
